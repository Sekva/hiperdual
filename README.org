#+DESCRIPTION: Rust library that implements Hyper Dual Numbers

* Introduction
Hyper Dual (the title is in Portuguese) numbers are another kind of numbers that can help with many things, including first and second derivatives of a real function.

I think it was introduced by [[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2011-886][Fike Alonso]] for some wing and aerodynamic things. Reading some others papers (you can find it, later i will add them to end of this readme), it's not exactly the more efficient way to calculate first and second orders derivatives, but that's fine.

The objective of this library is to provide some support for these numbers and some basic functions for common use.
